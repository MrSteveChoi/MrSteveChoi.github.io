# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations = sorted(Counter(citations).items(), key=lambda x:x[0], reverse=True)

        if len(citations) == 1:
            return min(citations[0][0], citations[0][1])

        print(citations)

        before_score = citations[0][0]
        all_paper_cnt = citations[0][1]

        for i in citations[1:]:
            print(f"for loop {i}")
            score, paper_cnt = i
            if score == 0:
                continue
            all_paper_cnt += paper_cnt

            print(f"score:{score} / paper_cnt:{all_paper_cnt}", '\n')

            if score == all_paper_cnt:
                return score
            
            elif score < all_paper_cnt:
                h_index_1 = min(score, all_paper_cnt)
                h_index_2 = min(before_score, all_paper_cnt - paper_cnt)
                h_index = max(h_index_1, h_index_2)
                return h_index

            before_score = score

        print("end for loop")
        print(f"before_score:{before_score} / paper_cnt:{paper_cnt}")
        return min(before_score, all_paper_cnt)
```

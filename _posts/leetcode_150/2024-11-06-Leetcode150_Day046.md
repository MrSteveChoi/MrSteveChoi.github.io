# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## **내 풀이**

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
     
        nums_set = set(nums)

        # The Longest Consecutive Elements Sequence
        lces = 0

        for i in nums:
            if i-1 not in nums_set:

                add_num = 1
                temp_lces = 1

                while (i+add_num) in nums_set:
                    temp_lces += 1
                    add_num += 1

                lces = max(lces, temp_lces)

        return lces
```

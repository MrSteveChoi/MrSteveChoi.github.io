# [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        intervals = deque(intervals)
        first_interval = intervals.popleft()
        l, r = first_interval[0], first_interval[1]

        answer = []
        while intervals:
            next_interval = intervals.popleft()
            next_l, next_r = next_interval[0], next_interval[1]

            if next_l >= l and next_r <= r:
                continue

            if r >= next_l:
                r = next_r
                continue

            answer.append([l, r])
            l, r = next_l, next_r

        answer.append([l, r])

        return answer
```
